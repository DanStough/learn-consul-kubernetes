# Content overview

This directory contains the unique assets required for each individual tutorial.
The directory names map directly to a collection or tutorial slug.

## When to use collection vs tutorial slug

Use the collection slug if the tutorials share common assets, and build on one another
as in the case of sequential collections or feature group tutorials (e.g. configuration-entries).

Use the tutorial slug if the tutorial can stand on its own and/or is included
in multiple collections.
